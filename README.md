I made this simple Landing Page using some of the new components and css class of Bootstrap 4

### Some of the features this page include are:
* css styles defined with scss and sass
* btn-outline
* carousel with indicators
* d-none mixed with d-md-block to hide the carousel title in mobile screens and show in screens md+ size 
* Scroll Spy
* Card
